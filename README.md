# Week4 - JavaScript Quiz

* Meets the criteria laid out, and if I did my job properly syntax errors/bugs have been addressed (& hopefully eliminated)

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```

*       Wasn't sure how many questions to include, although based on my code it is a fairly easy process to add more so I did not think that should be the main focus. 

One thing I am unsure of is my usage of Comments, somehow I feel as if I am simultaneously writing too much and too little. Comments on this would be greatly appreciate (although don't both yourself too much with it as the code is priority).
